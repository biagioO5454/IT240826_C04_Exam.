Dark Mode is a visual setting that changes the interface to darker colors, reducing eye strain, especially in low-light environments. 
It can also help save battery life on devices with OLED screens by using less power for darker pixels.
Additionally, many users find Dark Mode aesthetically pleasing and prefer it for its modern look.
